# ReactJS

- State is passed down from App level to component level (render target).
- Actions are passed from target component (place of event occurrence) to the App level (handle).
- To create static assets, run `yarn/npm run build`, the artefacts can be found in a folder called `build`.
- A mock backend can be used by installing json server, run `npm i json-server`.
